## Overview

This plugin utilizes the BridalLive API to offer a custom form system for booking appointments in bridal shops, as an alternative to BridalLive's default iframe booking system. It requires a BridalLive Retailer Account to connect via Retailer ID and API Key.

## Description

BridalLive Software's default iframe booking system has limitations, which led us to develop a custom form system using the BridalLive API. Users must have a BridalLive Retailer Account and connect using a Retailer ID and API Key. The plugin allows for easy placement of the booking form on your website using a shortcode.

### External Service Usage

This plugin integrates with BridalLive, a third-party service, to manage appointments. The data interactions are handled securely through BridalLive's API.
